## Simple Summary

This KIP proposes to add a ‘Widgetbot’ chatbox to the Kwenta dApp.

## Motivation

Adding a chatbox to Kwenta would help focus users' attention on the dApp instead of tabbing away to `#pro-trading` in Kwenta's Discord server.

The UI and Kwenta would benefit from an active chatbox in numerous ways:

- Obtaining and retaining users' attention.
- Encouraging anon users to become part of the community.
- Users sharing thoughts & TA ideas live whilst trading.
- Users could receive help within the app from other community members.

## Specification

Kwenta should integrate the Widgetbot.io chatbox on the 'Markets' pages. The widget should have a dedicated channel within the Kwenta Discord server.

There are a few trading websites which currently have similar chatboxes in place (Primedice, Stake, Nitrogen Sports), but notably no on-chain perps markets; this would be a unique feature for Kwenta and would bring a lot of life to an otherwise fairly static page.

Widgetbot is a good choice for chat integration; as it should require little to no extra moderation work, and the widget can be fully customised to suit Kwenta’s branding using CSS.
